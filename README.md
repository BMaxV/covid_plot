Plot the data from johns hopkins 

https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

with python.

There is a reporting delay in the data. Incubation varies from an average of 6 to a maximum of 14 days, so there is variance there as well.

See the official report from the RKI for an example (page 4):

Here are some curves about Germany, but I can do any country in the dataset.
